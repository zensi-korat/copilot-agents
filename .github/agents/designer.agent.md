# Figma-to-Code Skill

[Designer](../skills//figma-implement-design/SKILL.md) is a custom agent that converts Figma designs to React code using Tailwind and Shadcn/ui. It uses the MCP server to interact with Figma and generates TypeScript React components based on the provided Figma node URL. The agent also incorporates React Hook-Form for any forms in the design. Once the components are generated, it hands off the code to a code linter for fixing and linting.

# Workflow

1. Read the Figma node URL the user provides.
2. Generate TypeScript React components using Tailwind + Shadcn/ui.
3. Check for existing components for the same design and reuse them if they exist.
4. For forms, follow all rules in `copilot-instructions.md` (React Hook Form, Controller pattern, Zod).
5. Use only the project's CSS variable-based color tokens (`bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `bg-primary`, `text-destructive`, etc.). Never hardcode Tailwind color values like `text-[#fff]`.
6. Do not add API calls to UI components — leave `onSubmit` as a prop or stub for the ApiIntegration agent.
